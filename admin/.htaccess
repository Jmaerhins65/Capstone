             - `$1` refers to the first captured group (everything before the first `/`).
             - `$2` would be the second captured group, but itâ€™s not used in this case (might be a mistake).
         - The `[L]` flag indicates that this is the last rule to apply (no further rules will be processed if this one is applied). -->
